Welcome to Magrathea's documentation!
=====================================

Magrathea is a planet generator written in Python. It is not a fork of the
original Planet software, but a complete rewrite from scratch. Therefore,
Magrathea is Python 3 compatible and makes use of modern templates provided
by the `Jinja2`_ template engine.

Magrathea is developed and maintained by the `RootForum.org`_ team. It is open
source and subject to the conditions of the MIT license.
