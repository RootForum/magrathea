Magrathea Iterables
===================

This chapter describes iterable objects and the classes they are based on.

.. note::

   Python does not distinguish between interface, abstract and normal classes. However, this terminology has
   been used here as an analogy to demonstrate how these classes are used (and, more important, *intended* to
   be used) -- although Python does not provide any means for enforcing this intended usage.
